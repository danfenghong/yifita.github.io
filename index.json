A high-resolution point set is essential for point-based rendering and surface reconstruction. Inspired by the recent success of neural image super-resolution techniques, we progressively train a cascade of patch-based upsampling networks on different levels of detail end-to-end. We propose a series of architectural design contributions that lead to a substantial performance boost. The effect of each technical contribution is demonstrated in an ablation study. Qualitative and quantitative experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art learning-based and optimazation-based approaches, both in terms of handling low-resolution inputs and revealing high-fidelity details.","tags":["point cloud","super-resolution","deep learning","geometry processing"],"title":"Patch-base progressive 3D Point Set Upsampling","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524787200,"objectID":"45275d342533c1f0633acc26122b3285","permalink":"https://yifita.github.io/project/point-geometry/","publishdate":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/point-geometry/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["Deep Learning","geometry processing","point cloud"],"title":"Point-based geometry processing","type":"project"},{"authors":["Yifan Wang","FedericoPerazzi","BrianMcWilliams","AlexanderHornung","OlgaSorkine","ChristopherSchroers"],"categories":null,"content":" Results  MsLapSRN: Lai, Wei-Sheng, et al. \u0026ldquo;Fast and Accurate Image Super-Resolution with Deep Laplacian Pyramid Networks.\u0026rdquo; arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.01992 (2017).\nEDSR, MDSR: Lim, Bee, et al. \u0026ldquo;Enhanced deep residual networks for single image super-resolution.\u0026rdquo; The IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) Workshops.
